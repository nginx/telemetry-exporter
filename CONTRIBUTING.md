## Ask a Question

To ask a question please use [Github Discussions](https://github.com/nginxinc/telemetry-exporter/discussions).

You can also join our [Community Slack](https://community.nginx.org/joinslack) which has a wider NGINX audience.

Please reserve GitHub issues for feature requests and bugs rather than general questions.

## Getting Started

Read the usage and testing steps in the [README](README.md).

## Contributing

### Report a Bug

To report a bug, open an issue on GitHub with the label `bug` using the available bug report issue template. Please
ensure the issue has not already been reported.

### Suggest an Enhancement

To suggest an enhancement, please create an issue on GitHub with the label `enhancement` using the available feature
issue template.

### Open a Pull Request

- Fork the repo, create a branch, submit a PR when your changes are tested and ready for review
- Fill in [our pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

> **Note**
>
> If youâ€™d like to implement a new feature, please consider creating a feature request issue first to start a discussion
> about the feature.

### Issue lifecycle

- When an issue or PR is created, it will be triaged by the core development team and assigned a label to indicate the
  type of issue it is (bug, feature request, etc) and to determine the milestone. Please see the [Issue
  Lifecycle](ISSUE_LIFECYCLE.md) document for more information.

### F5 Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

F5 requires all external contributors to agree to the terms of the F5 CLA (available [here](https://github.com/f5/.github/blob/main/CLA/cla-markdown.md))
before any of their changes can be incorporated into an F5 Open Source repository.

If you have not yet agreed to the F5 CLA terms and submit a PR to this repository, a bot will prompt you to view and
agree to the F5 CLA. You will have to agree to the F5 CLA terms through a comment in the PR before any of your changes
can be merged. Your agreement signature will be safely stored by F5 and no longer be required in future PRs.

## Style Guides

### Git Style Guide

- Keep a clean, concise and meaningful git commit history on your branch, rebasing locally and squashing before
  submitting a PR
- Follow the guidelines of writing a good commit message as described here <https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/>
  and summarized in the next few points
  - In the subject line, use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
  - In the subject line, use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
  - Limit the subject line to 72 characters or less
  - Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the subject line
  - Add more detailed description in the body of the git message (`git commit -a` to give you more space and time in
    your text editor to write a good message instead of `git commit -am`)

### Go Style Guide

- Run `gofmt` over your code to automatically resolve a lot of style issues. Most editors support this running
  automatically when saving a code file.
- Run `go lint` and `go vet` on your code too to catch any other issues.
- Follow this guide on some good practice and idioms for Go - <https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments>
- To check for extra issues, install [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) and run `make lint` or
  `golangci-lint run`
